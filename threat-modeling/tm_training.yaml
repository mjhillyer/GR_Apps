    The STRIDE Methodology

    One of the methodologies we'll be using is called STRIDE, which helps us categorize and analyze different types of threats. Here's a brief overview:

    **Spoofing Identity:** Addresses the potential for someone to impersonate a legitimate user or system.

    **Tampering with Data:** Focuses on unauthorized alterations or modifications to data.

    **Repudiation:** Involves denying an action or event, making it difficult to trace back to its origin.

    **Information Disclosure:** Deals with unauthorized access to sensitive information.

    **Denial of Service (DoS):** Concerns preventing legitimate users from accessing a service.

    **Elevation of Privilege:** Examines unauthorized escalation of user privileges.

    By breaking down potential threats into these categories, we can more effectively plan and implement security measures.
