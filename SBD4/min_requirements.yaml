  title: Hologic Product Minimum Security Requirements
  prompt: To address the increasing risks associated with digital environments, 
    it is imperative to establish and enforce minimum security requirements that 
    all products must incorporate. These requirements are necessary to safeguard 
    user data, protect against unauthorized access and data breaches, and foster 
    trust and confidence in the product and its services. By implementing these 
    requirements, product developers can ensure the integrity and privacy of user 
    information, reduce potential security vulnerabilities, and align their practices 
    with industry standards and best practices.

  title: (MSR01) All authentication credentials shall be configurable and changeable.
  prompt: Are all of the authentication credentials configurable and changeable? This
    means that there are no hardcoded credentials int he product.

    If there are any hardcoded or fixed credentials or keys, answer No and list what 
    the fixed credentials or keys are in the Comment field on the following exception page.

    If there are no credentials or keys at all, answer "It doesn't apply"

  title: (MSR02) Product shall support user/role privilege levels that restrict user/role 
    permissions to the minimum required to perform necessary defined functions.
  prompt: Does the product support user/role privilege levels that restrict user/role
    permissions to the minimum required to perform necessary defined functions?

    Each user account is unique and changeable. All accounts are manageable by RBAC 
    (Role Based Access Controls) and only given minimum permissions to perform their roles. 

    In Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), access decisions are based on an individual's roles 
    and responsibilities within the organization or user base. The process of defining roles 
    is usually based on analyzing the fundamental goals and structure of an organization and 
    is usually linked to the security policy. For instance, in a medical organization, the 
    different roles of users may include those such as a doctor, nurse, attendant, patients, 
    etc. Obviously, these members require different levels of access in order to perform their 
    functions, but also the types of web transactions and their allowed context vary greatly 
    depending on the security policy and any relevant regulations (HIPAA, Gramm-Leach-Bliley, etc.).
    An RBAC access control framework should provide web application security administrators with 
    the ability to determine who can perform what actions, when, from where, in what order, and 
    in some cases under what relational circumstances.

    encryption algorithms.
  prompt: Does the product encrypt all PII, PHI, and sensitive data (including authentication
    credentials) at rest using FIPS 140-3 compliant Level 1 or better encryption?

    All sensitive data such as PII or PHI should be encrypted at rest and in transit.

  title: (MSR04) Product shall encrypt all PII, PHI, and other sensitive 
    data (including authentication credentials) in transit by default using FIPS 140-3 
    compliant Level 1 or higher standards for ciphers and key sizes.
  prompt: Does the product encrypt all PII, PHI, and other sensitive data (including
    authentication credentials) in transit using FIPS 140-3 compliant Level 1 or higher
    standards for ciphers and key sizes?

    When correctly implemented, TLS can provide a number of security benefits;

    Confidentiality - protection against an attacker from reading the contents of traffic.
    Integrity - protection against an attacker modifying traffic.
    Replay prevention - protection against an attacker replaying requests against the server.
    Authentication - allowing the client to verify that they are connected to the real server (note that the identity of the client is not verified unless client certificates are used).
    TLS is used by many other protocols to provide encryption and integrity and can be used in a number of different ways. 

    https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Transport_Layer_Protection_Cheat_Sheet.html

    All PII, PHI, and other sensitive data (including authentication credentials) is encrypted in 
    transit using industry-standard cryptography (e.g., TLS) that meets FIPS 140-3 compliant level 
    1 or higher standards for ciphers and key sizes.
