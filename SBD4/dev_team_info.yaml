  prompt: Hologic recognizes customer expectations and patient rights regarding privacy & security of sensitive
information both within the healthcare provider environment and in the conduct of Hologic business
activities. This workflow tool will walk you through the steps that enable engineering activities to support privacy &
security requirements for healthcare providers and patients. Hologic\'s Privacy Principles encompass
concepts and requirements that come from customers, broad regulatory requirements, international
privacy standards and practices, and other sources.

Hologic\'s products and services are deployed globally and thus Hologic, and their customers, are subject
to a myriad of regulations related to privacy, as well as security. The Hologic Secure Product Design and
Lifecycle Procedure provides the necessary steps to incorporate privacy & security into Hologic
engineering activities, while addressing interest in security by the FDA, GDPR and other regulatory
bodies.
